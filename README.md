Great! Here's how you can document the Cucumber plugin installation process using a VPN set to France, which can be useful when the plugin is unavailable in India:

üîå Installing Cucumber Plugin in IntelliJ (with VPN workaround)

üîπ Problem Encountered

In the company network or in the India region, the Cucumber for Java plugin may not appear or download in IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace due to:

Regional restrictions

Repository access limits

Firewall/proxy blocks


üîπ Solution: Use VPN (Set to France)

1. Connect to VPN:

Launch your company-approved VPN application (e.g., Zscaler, FortiClient).

Select France as the VPN location.

Ensure VPN is active and connected.



2. Open IntelliJ IDEA:

Navigate to File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Plugins.



3. Install Cucumber Plugin:

In the Marketplace tab, search for: Cucumber for Java.

If visible, click Install.

Wait for download and installation to complete.

Restart IntelliJ if prompted.



4. Verify Installation:

Go to Plugins ‚Üí Installed tab.

Ensure Cucumber for Java is listed and enabled.

üí° Tip

If VPN is not allowed or fails, you may also:

Download the plugin manually from JetBrains plugin repository:
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java

Install via "Install Plugin from Disk..." option in IntelliJ.
