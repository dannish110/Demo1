⚙️ IntelliJ IDEA Installation (Company Environment)

🔹 Step 1: Check Software Center

1. On your company-issued system, open the Software Center from the Start Menu.


2. In the search bar, type IntelliJ IDEA.


3. Look for IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.2.


4. If found:

Click on it and press Install.

Wait until the installation completes. The status should change to Installed.




🔹 Step 2: If 2021.3.2 Is Not Available

1. If the required version (2021.3.2) is not listed:

Open the Enterprise Store or Company Software Request Portal.

Search for or request the specific version: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.2.



2. Submit a Software Request Ticket if required:

Provide the reason (e.g., "Project compatibility with Java SDKs and plugin requirements").

Mention urgency, if applicable.



3. Once approved, install it via the Enterprise Store or follow IT instructions.



🔹 Step 3: Post-Installation Setup

1. Launch IntelliJ IDEA.


2. If prompted:

Choose “Do not import settings” for a fresh setup.

Allow plugins to install (especially Cucumber for Java).



3. Configure the JDK path:

File → Project Structure → SDKs → Add Java 11+.
